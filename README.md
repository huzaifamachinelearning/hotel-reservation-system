# hotel-reservation-system
This was a fourth semester project. The main focus of the project was database design.
We were required to make ER model of our chosen project, approve it from the instructor, design a database and develop basic front end. The front end was only there to demonstrate that you can connect your application to database and the changes made through the front end are reflected in your database.
Our project consisted of designing a hotel reservation system database which will be available to the hotel receptionist staff helping them in booking rooms, keeping records of guests,available and booked rooms ,generating bill etc.
Throug the front end you can search for available room, and book available rooms for guests.
The database and the front end is designed to also support beforehand reservation ie one could book a room (through a phone call etc) before actually coming to reside in the hotel
Technologies used sere sql plus, oracle sql developer and intellij idea.
To run the project one must generate the database by running project.sql file in sql plus or oracle sql developer. After that one could populate the database by running following files in the given order populate_recep,populate_roomType,populate_room.
After that you could run the RoomReservationForm file in  Itntellij idea project.Make sure to put  your own  username and password in place of "HUZAIFA" and "tiger" in the code
Lastly you could delete the whole database using deleteProject.sql file
